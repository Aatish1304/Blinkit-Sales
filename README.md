This Power BI dashboard provides an interactive sales analysis for Blinkit, an online grocery platform, helping businesses gain insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. The dashboard features key metrics such as total sales, average sales, number of items sold, and customer ratings. It also includes outlet performance analysis based on location, size, and type, allowing businesses to identify high-performing and underperforming areas.

The data was imported from a CSV file and processed in Power Query Editor, where column profiling and data cleaning steps were performed to ensure accuracy. Null values in the "Sales" column were identified and excluded, as they constituted less than 1% of the dataset. A consistent theme was applied to enhance the dashboardâ€™s readability, and various interactive visuals, including slicers, bar charts, and pie charts, were used for better data exploration.

DAX measures and calculated columns were implemented to derive insights, such as segmenting customers into spending categories. The dashboard highlights top-performing regions, best-selling product categories, and outlet sales trends over time. It also incorporates KPI cards displaying total revenue, revenue growth percentage, and profit margins, along with a time series analysis of outlet establishments.

Key findings reveal that Tier 3 outlets contribute the highest sales, while some product categories underperform. Recommendations include focusing marketing efforts on underperforming regions, expanding best-selling product categories, and enhancing promotions for low-performing items. Future enhancements will involve integrating real-time data feeds, predictive analytics, and additional interactive visuals, such as drill-through reports, for deeper insights.
